                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">
                       My teaching is dynamic and responsive, employing a variety of pedagogical approaches such as inquiry-based learning, 
                       explicit instruction, and collaborative projects. 
                       I strategically leverage educational technology to enhance engagement, provide diverse learning opportunities, and 
                       cater to different learning styles.
                       I will also explain KRC and Tech tools I use.......

                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">
                        I foster a positive and respectful classroom culture through clear and consistent routines, high expectations, 
                        and building strong, trusting relationships with students. 
                        I utilize strategies that promote active engagement, self-regulation, and critical thinking, minimizing disruptions and 
                        maximizing learning time.
